# CS370
What code were you given? 
We were given the game setup code. This consisted of GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py

What code did I create myself? 
The code that I created was the reinforcement learning algorithm. I also created the game loops that used Tensorflow and Keras libraries in order to help with the agent pathfinding. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are people who approach problems and help create ways to solve those problems. This matters because for consumers it helps push new technology. A great example of this is approaching the problem of analyzing a face for facial recognition that helped with the implementation of FaceID and similar technologies in consumer products. 
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When looking at this course when looking at a problem I first tried to understand what we are trying to accomplish. From there I went through what would be our limitations. After that I started looking at designs that would help me achieve these goals while understanding these limitations. I would research or use our resources in this process to help find designs and options to help me achieve my goals. 
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist I do have ethical obligations to the organization and the end user. For the organization I need to ensure that my code works, but also doesnâ€™t have errors that could cause harm to the organization because of vulnerabilities or data leaks. When looking at the end user I need to ensure that I am honoring their requests when looking at data collection. I need to make sure that I am limiting and protecting any data I collect from them. I also need to ensure that I protect the user and do all I can in ensuring that we protect any data of any kind that they have to provide to us.
